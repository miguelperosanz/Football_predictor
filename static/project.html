  <p>Hi. I am Miguel. And yes, I love football and I love machine learning. I know the web looks kind of simple but actually there is a lot of work behind. 
    If you are wondering what kind oftechnologies I used, you are on the right place. Let me divide the process in 3 steps:</p>
  <p><br />1) Getting data. As you might probably know, getting the data is usually one of the biggest part of the work. Well, this was not an exception. 
    I used web scraping applications for getting the team rates from the website sofifa.com. This site is a nice data source and it extracts the data used for 
    the videogame fifa.com. I got 8 seasons of teams from the main 5 leagues in Europe. Every seasons has between 30 and 100 rating-updates. I used basically 
    Beautifulsoup from Python. Regarding the results and statistics of the matches, I downloaded them from https://www.football-data.co.uk/ and I merged it by date 
    with the rates of the teams for the matchdays. The size of the matrix for the training and evaluation consisted of 14417 football games and 124 features (not all the 
    features were used).</p>
  <p>2) Machine learning part. As usual, not the longest part of the project. I used logistic regressions and linear regressions. No, don't think I did not try deep learning. 
    I did and I used Grid Search cross validation for searching the best hyperparameters. Surprisingly the results for the linear regression were a little bit more accurate 
    than for the neural network. If you are curious about it you can find the comparison 
    <a href="comparison.png" target="_blank"> 
      here.

  </p>
  <p>3) Visualization and deployment of results. For the graphs I used d3.js, a powerful library of javascript when it comes to data visualization. I deployed it by using Flask.</p>
  <p><br />And that's all folks. This is my little contribution to the world of predicting statistics in sports. A topic that I have always been passioned about. And of course 
    feel free to check the code in my Github account:
